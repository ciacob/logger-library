# logger-library
General purpose logger library for AIR-based AS3/Flex projects. Currently logs to the console and/or a file.
Also has built-in formatting and helper tools, such as the ability to hard-wrap the output, draw separators,
or print information about the Flash PLayer VM currently executing the code. When writing to disc, older log
messages can be archived or replaced.
